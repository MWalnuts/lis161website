<h2> Razer Naga Hex V2 </h2>

                    <p> Even though this mouse is advertised as a "for MOBA" gaming mouse, I find the Razer Naga Hex V2 to be so much more. Yes, it has 7 programmable buttons at the side (with the thumb grip/rest as an added bonus) for quicker skill-casting, but these buttons can also be programmed to perform specific actions on the computer by the use of macros. This results in having an easier time when performing daily tasks such as opening up my browser, going back and forward between pages and so on.
