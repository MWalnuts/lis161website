                <h2> Intel Core i7-6700K </h2>
          <div class="row">
                    <p> The i7-6700K is a beast when it comes to performance. Running at a base of  4.00GHz and has overclocking capabilities, this CPU is both for gamers and workspace enthusiasts. I still haven't overclocked mine because I don't have a reason to and I mainly use mine for gaming. My maximum temperature reading when gaming is around 65-68 degree Celsius. Those are good numbers especially when factoring in ambient room temperatures in the country and my MasterLiquid 120 liquid cooler from Cooler Master.

                 <h2> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 </h2>
          <div class="row">
                    <p> Being the minimum requirement to have VR-ready gear, the GTX 970 is one of the mid-range budget performers that one can buy on the market. I don't use it for VR because I have no money to purchase a VR machine, but for even modern game titles this GPU performs well. I often get around 77-81 degrees Celsius when gaming. My huge concern is the bottleneck between the i7-6700K and the GTX 970. My CPU is only running at around 40% performance when my GPU is running at max capacity, wasting the untapped 60% CPU performance.

               <h2> Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM </h2>
          <div class="row">
                    <p> 16GB of RAM is overkill for most users, but I personally like running multiple applications all at the same time, thus making 16GB a sweet spot for my setup.

              <h2> 250GB Samsung 850 EVO SSD</h2>
          <div class="row">
                    <p> I use my SSD as a boot up drive for faster boot times. I also put my most played games here in order to have faster load times and ultimately a smoother gaming experience. All hail SSDs.

                    <p> Because who doesn't love a larger space? Apparently my recently dead 1TB HDD dedicated storage for movies, TV series, etc. Sadface.
