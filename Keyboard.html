                    <p> I am currently using a Razer Blackwidow Chroma as my mechanical keyboard. I love it because of its Razer Mechanical Green Switches that, for me, is the perfect balance between clickiness and comfortability. I am not exactly sure why I chose the Chroma version, but I am glad I chose it. RGB lighting is far too entertaining to disregard when choosing your peripherals. Overall, it is great for both productivity and gaming.
