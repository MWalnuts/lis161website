                        Hi everyone! My name is Jordan and I wanted to showcase my gaming setup not because of bragging rights, but to inform my audience how my patience throughout selecting various factors, specifications, and hardwares got me where I am right now. No, my family's not rich. Yes, they wanted to buy a cheaper one. No, I wanted a better one. Yes, I patiently waited for a bigger budget. No, I wasn't tempted to give up. Yes, I got what I wanted. Now I hope that you enjoy browsing through my rig as much as I did creating this webpage. Cheers!<br><sub>All photos were taken from <em>google.com</em> and <em>razerzone.com</em> and do not visually represent my setup.</sub>
