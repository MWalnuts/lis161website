                    <p> By now you may think that I am a Razer fanboy and you might not be wrong on that part. Regardless, I am not a fan of headphones because of their bulky builds and that uncomfortable feeling when you're wearing one for too long. That is why I only use my Razer Kraken 7.1 V2 gaming headset when I am really serious about the audio quality of things. The mic is also excellent and I often use it when I am voice chatting with my friends. The RGB-lit Razer Logo at the sides of the headset is quite useless though. I can't really appreciate something that I can't see because I am wearing it.
